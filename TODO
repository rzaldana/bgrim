0. Implement bg.arr.insert function, which will insert an element into an array at the given index and move all elements after that index to the right 
1. Implement logic in normalize_tokens() function that separates options from args (use bg.arr.insert function to insert '--' in between the two)
2. Implement normalize_tokens() func, which will separate all options and args into individual tokens for further processing (will use __cli.is_valid_long_opt_token and __cli.is_valid_short_opt_token to route a token to the right normalizing function)
2. Implement bg.cli.name function which sets the name to be displayed as the executable in the help message
3. Implement bg.cli.description function to set description of utility to be printed out in help message
4. Implement bg.cli.help_message to override auto-generated help message
5. Implement bash native replacement for basename and substitute it in bg.get_parent_routine_name

NOTE: we will process tokens instead of options

Logic inside cli.parse that should be it's own function:
- spec_lines_to_table: reads in the spec lines as provided by cli.add_* functions and turns into a table with a set schema
- generate_opt_help_message: reads in a spec table  

NOTE: The difference between declaring a variable and setting a variable is relevant.
When we run 'declare myvar' (or any variation thereof, such as `declare -a myvar` or `local -a myvar`), we are only DECLARING a variable. The variable is declared and will show up when we run `declare -p myvar`. However, the variable is unset, so if we have the `-u` (nounset) option set, any attempt to read the variable's value WILL fail.
